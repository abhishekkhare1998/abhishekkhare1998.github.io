                        <p>I had been very fortunate to manage Abhishek in my team for a couple of years. He is sincere, extremely talented, easily approachable, witty, and has the eagerness to learn continuously. His contribution to the team is invaluable and I'm sure he'll do a commendable job on his future endeavors. I highly recommend Abhishek and would love to work with him again.
                            Thank you Abhishek for all your contributions and wishing you all the very best for all your future endeavors.</p>

                        <p>Had the pleasure of working with Abhishek for two years at WDC. 
                            In these years, he has developed various test scenarios and owned the Black Box validation activity for several essential Firmware features on different product lines.
                             His contributions were valuable to the team and his work with bugfix validation has aided in the timely release of Firmware versions for our memory products.
                              He has shown a keen understanding of the underlying system which is exceptional for any peers in his category.
                              He is a very resolute professional and is always willing to go the extra mile and he would surely be an asset to any team he joins in the future.</p>

                        <p>I enjoyed working with Abhishek on the same project in WDC Company, Abhishek progresses and develops according to the requirements of several test infrastructure activities, I'm sure that his outcomes will help to increase the quality of validation,
                            Thank you for your contribution, good luck with your next challenges.</p>

                        <p>He worked diligently on the project and was very curious to know even the small details of the project. This curiosity helped him to have a holistic knowledge of the project. He helped in creating simulations, creating and analyzing various plots to better visualize some features. His knowledge in the field of digital signal processing came in handy for this project. He did some more refinements in our system to make it more adaptive which was a big help to our team.</p>
